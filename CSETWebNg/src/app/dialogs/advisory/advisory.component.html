      <p>The {{appLongName}} ({{appShortName}})
        <sup>®</sup> is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a
        robust cyber
        security program within the organization. A self-assessment with {{appShortName}}
        <sup>®</sup> cannot reveal all types of security weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an
        organization's
        security posture.</p>
      <p>The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
        hardware/software configuration
        review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk assessment. {{appShortName}}
        <sup>®</sup> is not intended as a substitute for in‑depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as
        performed by trained
        professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach
        including
        facility walk-downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices. Consideration should
        also be
        given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
        non-production
        systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not compromise
        production or
        safety.</p>
      <p>{{appShortName}}
        <sup>®</sup> assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team
        consisting of representatives
        from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
        representatives
        must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has the
        span
        of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.</p>
      <p>Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
        manner appropriate
        to their sensitivity.</p>
