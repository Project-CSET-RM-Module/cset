            Introduction
        </h1>

        <p class="intro">
            Template instructions and directives are given in italicized 10 point font and should be replaced
            appropriately.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">This security plan template is intended to be used as a tool for the development of a security
            plan. This template
            will assist you in identifying the controls in place and those needing further implementation based upon the
            answers provided in the accompanying Cybersecurity Evaluation Tool (CSET) assessment. The basic process for
            this
            plan development would be to first determine risk, second select the countermeasures necessary to mitigate
            the
            risk to an acceptable level, and finally follow through to ensure that the countermeasures are implemented
            to
            the expected level.</p>

        <p class="intro">
            The purpose of the security plan is to provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and
            describe the controls
            in place or planned, for meeting those requirements. The site cybersecurity plan also delineates
            responsibilities
            and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system. The security plan should be viewed as
            documentation
            of the structured process of planning adequate, cost effective security protection for a system. It should
            reflect
            input from various managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners, the
            system
            operator, and the system security manager. Additional information may be included in the basic plan and the
            structure
            and format organized according to agency needs, so long as the major sections described in this document are
            adequately covered and readily identifiable.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
            The System Owner is responsible for ensuring that the security plan is prepared and for implementing the
            plan and monitoring
            its effectiveness. Security plans should reflect input from various individuals with responsibilities
            concerning
            the system, including functional “end users,” Information Owners, the System Administrator, and the System
            Security
            Manager

                recommendations
                do not take into account any cost benefit analysis with respect to implementing a control.
            </li>
            <li>
                Basic security assurance level determinations carried over from the assessment. In developing a security
                plan it is recommended
                that a deeper risk analysis is conducted to ensure that the selection of controls is not overly
                conservative
                (incurring undo costs) or optimistic (leaving excessive risk exposure).

        <h2 id="goto">
            2.1. Executive Management
        </h2>

        <p>
            Often this role is comprised of the Board of Directors and CEO.  Executive management is ultimately
            responsible for the security
            of the organization but will most likely delegate tasks and actual implementation.

                (CISO)</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
            CSO or CISO is the senior level executive within an organization responsible for establishing and
            maintaining the enterprise
            vision, strategy and program to ensure information assets are adequately protected. The CISO directs staff
            in
            identifying, developing, implementing and maintaining processes across the organization to reduce
            information
            and information technology (IT) risks, respond to incidents, establish appropriate standards and controls,
            and
            direct the establishment and implementation of policies and procedures. The CISO is also usually responsible
            for information related compliance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Typically, the CISO's influence reaches the whole organization. Responsibilities include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Information security and information assurance</li>
            <li>Information regulatory compliance (e.g., US PCI DSS, FISMA, GLBA, HIPAA; UK Data Protection Act 1998;
                Canada
                PIPEDA)
            </li>
            <li>Information risk management</li>
            <li>Supply chain risk management</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity</li>
            <li>Information technology controls for financial and other systems</li>
            <li>Information privacy</li>

            <li>Identity and access management</li>
            <li>Security Architecture (e.g. Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture)</li>
            <li>IT investigations, digital forensics, eDiscovery</li>
            <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity management</li>
            <li>Information Security Operations Center (ISOC)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>
            2.3. Security Steering Committee
        </h2>

        <p>
            The security steering committee is composed of a representative of all the key stakeholders in IT security.
            These stake holders
            are often representatives of the executive council, CISO or CSO, IT management, physical security personnel,
            help desk, and key application and digitial asset owners.   This committee meets regularly often quarterly
            to
            review policies and procedures, security controls implementation progress, and determine future direction
            for
            security within a company.
        </p>

        <p>
            The security steering committee is responsible for making decisions on tactical and strategic security
            issues within the
            enterprise as a whole and should not be tied to one or more business units. The group should be made up of
            people
            from all over the organization so they can view risks and the effects of security decisions on individual
            departments
            and the organization as a whole. The CEO should head this committee, and the CFO, CIO, department managers,
            and
            chief internal auditor should all be on it. This committee should meet at least quarterly and have a well
            defined
            agenda. Some of the group’s responsibilities are listed next:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Define the acceptable risk level for the organization.</li>
            <li>Develop security objectives and strategies.</li>
            <li>Determine priorities of security initiatives based on business needs.</li>
            <li>Review risk assessment and auditing reports.</li>
            <li>Monitor the business impact of security risks.</li>
            <li>Review major security breaches and incidents.</li>
            <li>Approve any major change to the security policy and program.</li>
        </ul>




        <p>
            They should also have a clearly defined vision statement in place that is set up to work with and support
            the organizational
            intent of the business. The statement shouldbe structured in a manner that provides support for the goals of
            confidentiality, integrity, and availability as they pertain to the business objectives of the organization.
            This in turn should be followed, or supported, by a mission statement that provides support and definition
            to
            the processes that will apply to the organization and allow it to reach its business goals.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.4. System Owners
        </h2>

        <p>
            The system owner is responsible for one or more systems, each of which may hold and process data owned by
            different data
            owners. A system owner is responsible for integrating security considerations into application and system
            purchasing
            decisions and development projects. The system owner is responsible for ensuring that adequate security is
            being
            provided by the necessary controls, password management, remote access controls, operating system
            configurations,
            and so on. This role must ensure the systems are properly assessed for vulnerabilities and must report any
            to
            the incident response team and data owner.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.5. Data Owners
        </h2>

        <p>
            The data owner (information owner) is usually a member of management who is incharge of a specific business
            unit, and who
            is ultimately responsible for the protection and use of a specific subset of information. The data owner has
            due care responsibilities and thus will be held responsible for any negligent act that results in the
            corruption
            or disclosure of the data. The data owner decides upon the classification of the data he is responsible for
            and
            alters that classification if the business need arises. This person is also responsible for ensuring that
            the
            necessary security controls are in place, defining security requirements per classification and backup
            requirements,
            approving any disclosure activities, ensuring that proper access rights are being used, and defining user
            access
            criteria. The data owner approves access requests or may choose to delegate this function to business unit
            managers.
            And it is the data owner who will deal with security violations pertaining to the data he is responsible for
            protecting. The data owner, who obviously has enough on his plate, delegates responsibility of the
            day-to-day
            maintenance of the data protection mechanisms to the data custodian.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.6. Security Administrators
        </h2>

        <p>
            Anyone who has a root account on Unix or Linux systems or an administrator account on Windows or Macintosh
            systems actually
            has security administrator rights. (Unfortunately, too many people have these accounts in most
            environments.)
            This means they can give and take away permissions and set security configurations.  However, just because a
            person has a root or administrator account does not mean they are fulfilling the security administrator
            role.
            A security administrator’s tasks are many, and include creating new system user accounts, implementing new
            security
            software, testing security patches and components, and issuing new passwords. The security administrator
            should
            not actually approve new system user accounts. This is the responsibility of the supervisor.  The security
            administrator
            must make sure access rights given to users support the policies and data owner directives.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.7. Supervisors/Managers
        </h2>

        <p>
            The supervisor role, also called user manager, is ultimately responsible for all user activity and any
            assets created and
            owned by these users. The supervisor responsibilities would include ensuring that employees understand their
            responsibilities with respect to security, distributing initial passwords, making sure the employees’
            account
            information is up-to-date, and informing the security administrator when an employee is fired, suspended, or
            transferred.  Any change that pertains to an employee’s role within the company usually affects what access
            rights
            they should and should not have, so the user manager must inform the security administrator of these changes
            immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2.8. Users
        </h2>

        <p>
            The user is any individual who routinely uses the data for work related tasks. The user must have the
            necessary level of
            access to the data to perform the duties within their position and is responsible for following operational
            security
            procedures to ensure the data’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability to others.

            cost benefit analysis for the level of controls selected. It is recommended that a general risk analysis be
            performed.
            A good risk assessment should include an evaluation of the value of the protected assets and information, an
            examination of the consequences to the organization in the event of a successful attack, an examination of
            the
            threat if possible, and the cost of implementing mitigating controls.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">threats × vulnerability × asset value = total risk
        </p>

        <p class="intro">total risk – countermeasures = residual risk
        </p>


        <h4>Consequence</h4>
        <p class="intro">The examination of the consequences of an attack should include:
        </p>
        <ul class="intro">
            <li>How many people could sustain injuries requiring a hospital stay?</li>
            <li>How many people could be killed?</li>
            <li>Estimate the potential cost of losing capital assets or the overall economic impact. (Consider the cost
                of site
                buildings, facilities, equipment, etc.)</li>
            <li>Estimate the potential cost in terms of economic impact to both the site and surrounding communities.
                (Consider
                any losses to community structures and any costs associated with displacement.)</li>
            <li>Estimate the potential cost of environmental cleanup to the site and surrounding communities. (Consider
                the cost
                for cleanup, fines, litigation, long term monitoring, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Threat</h4>
        <p class="intro">The threat portion of the equation can be deduced from the recommended implementation
            priorities list. The priorities
            are based on incident data collected by the ICS-CERT watch floor and subject matter experts as of the time
            of
            publication of CSET. Top priorities are controls that mitigate the most actively exploited vulnerabilities
            with
            the most significant consequences.
        </p>

        <h4>Cost Benefit Analysis</h4>
        <p class="intro">The cost of implementing controls with respect to the additional security provided is the final
            step in selecting
            the controls to implement.

        <h2>
            3.1 Basic Model
        </h2>

        <p>
            Traditional security models define three areas of consideration Confidentiality, Integrity, and
            Availability. The security
            plan should address each of these areas with respect to data and systems.
        </p>

        <h3>
            3.1.1 Confidentiality
        </h3>

        <p>Confidentiality refers to preventing the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems.
            For example,
            a credit card transaction on the Internet requires the credit card number to be transmitted from the buyer
            to
            the merchant and from the merchant to a transaction processing network. The system attempts to enforce
            confidentiality
            by encrypting the card number during transmission, by limiting the places where it might appear (in
            databases,
            log files, backups, printed receipts, and so on), and by restricting access to the places where it is
            stored.
            If an unauthorized party obtains the card number in any way, a breach of confidentiality has occurred.

        </p>

        <p>Confidentiality is necessary for maintaining the privacy of the people whose personal information a system
            holds.
        </p>

        <h3>
            3.1.2 Integrity
        </h3>

        <p>In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data
            over
            its entire life cycle.  This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
            This
            is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of
            Consistency
            as understood in the classic ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) model of transaction
            processing.
            Integrity is violated when a message is actively modified in transit. Information security systems typically
            provide message integrity in addition to data confidentiality.
        </p>

        <h3>
            3.1.3 Availability
        </h3>

        <p>For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This
            means
            that the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect
            it,
            and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems
            aim
            to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures,
            and
            system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks.
