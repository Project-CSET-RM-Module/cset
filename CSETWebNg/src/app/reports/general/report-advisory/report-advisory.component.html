<h1>Advisory</h1>

<p>
    CSET® is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust
    cybersecurity program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of security
    weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
</p>

<p>
    The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
    hardware/software configuration
    review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex risk assessment. CSET® is not intended
    as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained professionals.
    Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach including facility
    walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices. Consideration should also be
    given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
    non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not
    compromise production or safety.
</p>

<p>
    CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
    of representatives from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential.
    The representatives must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one
    individual has the span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
</p>

<p>
    Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
    manner appropriate to their sensitivity.
