                                Cyber Resilience Review (CRR) Assessment</a>
                        provides a measure of an organization’s cyber
                        resilience capabilities. The CRR Assessment also enables an organization to assess its
                        capabilities relative to v1.1 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
                        Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) with CRR results depicted in terms of the NIST CSF. A facilitator
                        should review the CRR Method Description and Assessment User Guide as a starting point for
                        preparing and executing the CRR Assessment.

        <div class="mb-4">
                <h5>The CRR Assessment</h5>


                <p>
                        The CRR is a lightweight, interview-based assessment method that was created by the Cybersecurity and
                        Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for the purpose of evaluating the cybersecurity and service
                        continuity practices of critical infrastructure owners and operators.
                        The CRR Assessment,
                        consisting of 10 domains of practice with 299 questions, is typically delivered in a six-hour
                        interactive workshop. Each domain represents important capabilities that contribute to the cyber
                        resilience of an organization. The number of goals and practice questions varies by domain, but
                        the set of Maturity Indicator Level (MIL) questions and the concepts they encompass are the same
                        for all domains. The MIL questions examine the institutionalization of practices within an
                        organization.
                </p>



                <p>The CRR reflects an organization’s capabilities at a single point in time—at the time of the
                        assessment. It seeks to understand the cybersecurity management of business services, and their
                        associated assets, that are critical for an organization’s mission success. The CRR measures
                        essential cybersecurity capabilities and behaviors to provide meaningful indicators of an
                        organization’s operational resilience during normal operations and during times of operational
                        stress.</p>

                <p>The assessment does not consider:</p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>activities that are planned or are in the process of implementation</li>
                        <li>practices that have not been performed for extended periods of time. For example, if the
                                organization has a disaster recovery plan that, in the opinion of the participants, is
                                out of date to the point of being unusable, the plan should not be considered.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="mb-4">
                <h5>Critical Service Scope</h5>

                <p>The CRR has a service-oriented approach, meaning that it is intended to assess the organization's
                        management of a specific mission critical service. Scoping the assessment is critical because
                        answers to the CRR questions must be provided in relation to a specific service and the assets
                        that underpin that service.</p>
                <p>A critical service must be selected, and is defined as:</p>
                <p>A set of activities an organization carries out in the performance of a duty or in the production of
                        a product that is so critical to the organization's success that its disruption would severely
                        impact continued operations or success in meeting the organization's mission.</p>
                <p>Organizations typically have a set of critical services that define their mission. The selection of a
                        critical service for assessment—rather than assessing the organization as a whole—helps to scope
                        the assessment and tie the results to the organization's mission.</p>
                <p>Below are some examples of organizations and their typical critical services that might be selected
                        as part of a CRR Assessment:</p>

                <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>banks and other financial
                                institutions: clearing and settlement, mortgage application processing</li>
                        <li>emergency services
                                providers: processing 911 calls, dispatch</li>
                        <li>electrical power plants:
                                electricity generation, electricity distribution</li>
                        <li>hospitals: clinical
                                services, prescription management</li>
                        <li>government agencies: court
                                case management, benefit management</li>
                        <li>manufacturing companies:
                                machining operations, order processing</li>
                        <li>airports: air traffic
                                control, fuel management</li>

                <h5>Practice Questions Structure</h5>

                <p>Each practice question contains a 3-point response scale to evaluate the degree
                        to which the organization has implemented each practice. Each question has three
                        possible answers:

                        require a separate answer for each of the four
                        assets while other questions refer to all assets.</p>

                <p>The four asset types are:</p>

                <ul>
                        <li><strong>People</strong> -
                                the staff (both internal and external to the organization) such as people that support
                                data centers or otherwise use information and communications technology to operate and
                                monitor the service.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Information</strong>
                                - account information, technology asset configuration files, operational data, customer
                                information and other information necessary for the delivery of the service.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Technology</strong>
                                – computers (hardware), software, control systems, or other technology including
                                external information systems used by the organization to deliver the service.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Facilities</strong>
                                – offices buildings, data centers and other physical structures supporting the delivery

                        The MIL questions examine the institutionalization of CRR practices within an organization.
                        Institutionalization means that cybersecurity practices become a deeper, more lasting part of
                        the organization because they are managed and supported in meaningful ways. When cybersecurity
                        practices become more institutionalized—or “embedded”—managers can have more confidence in the
                        practices’ predictability and reliability. The practices also become more likely to be sustained
                        during times of disruption or stress to the organization.

                <p>A Maturity Indicator Level (MIL) is assigned to the each CRR domain. It represents a consolidated
                        view of performance. The MIL scale itself uses six maturity levels, each with rigorous, defined
                        components:</p>

                <h6>MIL0 Incomplete -&gt; MIL1 Performed -&gt; MIL2 Planned -&gt;
                        MIL3 Managed -&gt; MIL4 Measured -&gt; MIL5 Defined </h6>


                <h6>MIL0 Incomplete</h6>
                <p>All practices in the domain are not being fully performed as measured by responses to the relevant
                        CRR questions in the domain.</p>

                <h6>MIL1 Performed</h6>
                <p>All practices that support the goals in a domain are being performed as measured by responses to the
                        relevant CRR questions.</p>

                <h6>MIL2 Planned</h6>
                <p>All specific practices in the CRR domain are not only performed but are also supported by planning,
                        policy, stakeholders, and relevant standards and guidelines.</p>

                <h6>MIL3 Managed</h6>
                <p>All practices in a domain are performed, planned, and have the basic governance infrastructure in
                        place, are appropriately staffed, adequately funded and managed for risk.</p>

                <h6>MIL4 Measured</h6>
                <p>All practices in a domain are performed, planned, managed, monitored, and controlled. A measured
                        process or practice is periodically evaluated for effectiveness, evaluated against its practice
                        description and plan, and periodically reviewed with higher level management.</p>

                <h6>MIL5 Defined</h6>
                <p>
                        All practices in a domain are performed, planned, managed, measured, and consistent across all
                        constituencies within an organization who have a vested interest in the performance of the
                        practice. At MIL5, a process or practice is defined by the organization and tailored by
                        individual operating units and supported by improvement information that is collected by and
                        shared among operating units for the overall benefit of the organization.
                </p>

                <h6>MIL Progression</h6>
                <p>In the above progression, an organization can only attain a given MIL if it has attained all lower
                        MILs. In other words, an organization that fails to perform all of the cybersecurity practices
                        at MIL1 in a domain would also fail to reach MIL2 in that domain, even if it would have
                        satisfied all the requirements at MIL2.
