          The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 1.0 measures cybersecurity maturity with five levels and
          aligns a set of processes and practices with the type and sensitivity of information to be protected and the
          associated range of threats. The model consists of maturity processes and cybersecurity best practices from
          multiple cybersecurity standards, frameworks and other references, as well as inputs from the broader
          community. CMMC is broken into five different levels of Processes and Capabilities (which are further broken
          down into Practices).

          The new Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 streamlines the number of levels from 5 to 3.
          The most critical change is the removal of the third-party facilitated assessment certifications for Level 1
          certification (and a subset of non-prioritized acquisitions assigned by DoD as Level 2) which now require only
          an <strong>annual self-assessment</strong> and <strong>accompanying contractor affirmation</strong> in the
          Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS).

        The CRR is a no-cost, voluntary, non-technical assessment to evaluate an organization’s operational resilience
        and cybersecurity practices. The CRR may be conducted as a self-assessment or as a facilitated assessment. The
        CRR assesses enterprise programs and practices across a range of ten domains including risk management, incident
        management, service continuity, and others. The assessment is designed to measure existing organizational
        resilience as well as provide a gap analysis for improvement based on recognized best practices.

          Ransomware poses an increasing threat and continues to rise as a top
          cyber threat impacting both businesses and government agencies.
          Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an
          organization's data and demand payment to restore access. In some
          instances, attackers may also steal an organization's information and
          demand an additional payment in return for not disclosing the
          information to authorities, competitors, or the public. Ransomware
          disrupts or halts an organization's operations and poses a dilemma for
          management: pay the ransom and hope that the attackers keep their word
          about restoring access and not disclosing data, or do not pay the
          ransom and restore operations themselves. The methods used to gain
          access to an organization's information and systems are common to
          cyberattacks more broadly, but they are aimed at forcing a ransom to
          be paid. Ransomware attacks target the organization's data.

          To understand your cybersecurity posture and assess how well your
          organization is equipped to defend and recover from a ransomware
          incident, take the Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA).

      Cybersecurity tools have traditionally focused on securing the information technology stack starting at the operating system (OS) level. But there is a whole layer of code below the OS that currently goes unmonitored. Firmware presents a large and ever-expanding attack surface that is often overlooked, but it is a single point of failure in devices and is one of the stealthiest methods an attacker can use to compromise devices at scale. Firmware is a set of programs and data that is stored on a chip instead of a hard drive. It is crucial to system operation, providing instructions and guidance for the device to communicate with other devices or perform a set of basic tasks and functions as the software intended. Just like code at the OS level or above, firmware can have vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to take control of devices on an organization’s network. Firmware attacks can not only steal data, but they can also cripple an organization’s infrastructure by rendering critical devices unusable.

	  To understand your cybersecurity posture and assess how well your organization is equipped to defend and recover from a Vulnerabilities Below the OS, take the VBOS Readiness Assessment (VBOS RA).
