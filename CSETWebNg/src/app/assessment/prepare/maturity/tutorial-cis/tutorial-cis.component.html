    <div class="mb-2">
        <p class="mb-4">The Critical Infrastructure Survey (CIS) goal is to assess
                the foundational and essential cybersecurity practices of an organization's critical service to
                identify dependencies, capabilities and emerging effects of the organization's current
                cybersecurity posture. CIS focuses on a service-based-view versus a programmatic-view of cybersecurity.
                Critical services are assessed against more than 80 cybersecurity controls grouped under five top-level
                domains: <strong><span style="color:#174F78;">cybersecurity management, cybersecurity forces,
                        cybersecurity controls, cyber incident response, and cyber dependencies</span></strong>. A CIS
                provides your organization with an effective assessment of cybersecurity controls in-place for critical
                services to support cybersecurity planning, resource allocation, and performance evaluation.</p>
        
        <p class="section-h">
            <span>What is a Critical Service?</span></p>
        
        <p><span><em>Critical Service &ndash; A set of activities that the
                    organization carries out, in the production of a product or while providing services to its
                    customers, that are so important to the success of the organization that disruption to the service
                    would severely impact the organization's operations or business. &nbsp;</em></span></p>
        
        <p><span>A basic principle to remember throughout the survey is the
                difference between a <strong><span style="color:#174F78;">critical service</span></strong> and a
                <strong><span style="color:#174F78;">cyber service</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p><span>A <strong><span style="color:#174F78;">cyber
                        service</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(23, 79, 120);">&nbsp;</span>is any combination of
                equipment and devices (hardware); applications and platforms (software), communications, and data that
                is integrated to provide specific cyber services.&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p class="mb-4"><span>A <strong><span style="color:#174F78;">critical
                        service</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(23, 79, 120);">&nbsp;</span>(CS) is a service
                that the loss thereof would result in physical destruction, safety, and health effects (e.g., a chemical
                release or loss of traffic controls), theft of sensitive information that can be exploited, business
                interruption (e.g., denial of service), or other economic loss to the organization or its
                customers/users.</span></p>
        
        <p class="section-h">
            <span>Identifying the Scope of the Assessment</span></p>

        <p><span>Identifying the Scope of the Assessment is important because
                answers to the assessment questions must be provided in relation to a specific service. The scope of the
                assessment is determined by three factors:&nbsp;</span></p>

            <li ><strong><span style="color: rgb(23, 79, 120);">Critical
                        service scope</span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong>&nbsp;Which service will
                be the focus of the assessment?&nbsp;</li>
            <li ><strong><span style="color: rgb(23, 79, 120);">Organizational
                        scope</span></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Which parts of the organization deliver the
                critical service?</li>
            <li ><strong><span style="color: rgb(23, 79, 120);">Asset
                        scope</span></strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Which assets (people, technology, information, and
                facilities) are required for delivery of the service?</li>

        <p><span>As you start to answer questions, please take note that the
                CIS is an interactive assessment with multiple levels of question content and responses. In an effort to
                show the breadth and depth of each question, you'll notice that some material is grayed out. This
                is intentional. The assessment content will become active (and no longer grayed out) depending upon your
                response.</span></p>
        
        <p><span>Please also note that when you choose a particular response,
                some question content may no longer be available. The assessment is performing as expected. The
                iterative material helps produce a comprehensive and useful scoring mechanism throughout the assessment
                and in the CIS results and reports.</span></p>
